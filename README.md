# Password-Generator-with-Prompts

##Description

This is a random password generator for any user to get their own custom password. The password generator application source code was not working and needed to be debugged. The original source code did not generate a password for the user to use and did not have options for the user to select when generating a password. In order to fix this issue, the javascript file needed some additional functions added and prompts for a user to select password criteria. These changes include, creating a generate password funtion that has window prompts added in the function to select the different characters needed to generate a password, as well as being able to make a password between 8-128 characters. Also, to add the 4 different types of charatcers (lowercase letters, uppercase letters, special charatcers, and numbers), variables were created to represent each type of character while linking them to the ASCII character code list to pull from. After these changes were made, any user can interact with the application and create their own password! Each window prompt that appears asks the user for the special charatcers they would like to use: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. With these changes, any person can have a unique password for themselves for their professional or personal use.
